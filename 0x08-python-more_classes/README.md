iHow do you define a rectangle class in Python?
The class called Rectangle has two attributes: length and width, which are initialized using the __init__ method (a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created). An instance of the Rectangle class called my_rectangle is created with a length of 5 and width of 3.
